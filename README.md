React App with Redux:
In a declarative UI like React, state is key and we should take good care of it. Redux is all about state. 
The three principles
1.	The state of the app is stored in one JavaScript object.
2.	The state is read-only, but we can change the state by describing a change with another JavaScript object called action.
3.	Changes are executed by pure functions called reducers. A reducer accepts the current state and an action and returns a new state or the same state.

Key concepts
1.	Redux follows the one-way data flow of React.
2.	Redux keep the state of the application in a single read-only JS object.
3.	To change the state we dispatch actions and reducers process the changes.
4.	All the reducers receive all the actions.
